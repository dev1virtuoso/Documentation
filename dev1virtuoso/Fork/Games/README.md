Remark:
First stage: Fairing is required when you open the Earth's atmosphere range

Second stage: When the fuel of the first stage is equal to 20%, stage separation should be performed

Third stage: When separated from the payload, the third stage will be used

fourth stage: Entry Burn is due when the first stage is about to return to Earth

fifth stage: When the first stage is about to return to land, a landing burn should be performed
