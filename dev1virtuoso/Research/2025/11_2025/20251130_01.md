## Executive Summary  
Heracles is a completely open-source humanoid robotics research platform that has evolved from 2016–2025 chased the absolute maximum possible degrees of freedom and human-like flexibility, and from 2025–2026 pivoted to the absolute minimum cost while still satisfying three non-negotiable physical demonstrations:

1. Single leg straight raise above head (hip flexion ≥ 155°, foot touches head)  
2. Full 180°–190° front split (一字馬)  
3. 90°+ backbend bridge (腰部後折 90°–95°)

The project now contains five fully documented hardware generations. Physical construction resumes in 2026 with targeting a complete, walking, dancing, back-bending robot for **HKD 5,800–6,000** (≈ USD 740–770) using only off-the-shelf 2026 parts.

## Version Evolution & Motor Count

| Version | Year | Actuation Philosophy | Total Motors | Total Realistic BOM (USD) | Key Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | 2016 | Rigid + simple spur gears | 46 | ~689 | Proof of concept |
| V2 | 2020 | Rigid + 5-segment waist + full fingers/toes | 152 | ~1,749 | Maximum DOF theory |
| V3 | 2023 | Full tendon antagonistic (no compromise) | 141 | ~7,400 (with proper 10:1 motors) | Theoretical peak performance |
| V4 | 2024 | Tendon + spring-return hybrid | 73 | ~4,300 | First realistic price |
| V5 | 2025 | Ultra-cost-optimized under-actuated | 46 | HKD 5,940 (~USD 760) | Actually buildable under HKD 6,000 |
| V6 | 2026 | Enhanced dexterity with micro actuators | 66 | ~1,522–1,747 (est.) | Independent fingers/toes for fine manipulation |

## Critical Torque Reality Check

| Motion | Required Peak Torque | Bare 1.2 N·m | 5:1 Planetary (V5) | 10:1 Planetary (V3–V4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-leg stance (25 kg) | 18–25 N·m hip | Collapse | OK (7–8 N·m + momentum) | Comfortable |
| Jump / fast squat | 30–45 N·m knee | Impossible | Marginal (needs skill) | Easy |
| Leg raise to head | 15–18 N·m hip | Impossible | Achieved | Easy |
| 90° backbend (5 segments) | 6–9 N·m per segment | Overheat | Achieved | Easy |

> All versions after V1 **must** use planetary geared steppers. V5 uses the new 2026 ultra-cheap 5:1 series.

## Recommended Commercial Geared Steppers (2025–2026)

| Model (2026 price) | Ratio | Output Torque | Weight | Single Price (2026 bulk) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZLTECH ZL57HS09-1005 + integrated 5:1 planetary | 5:1 | 7–8 N·m | 380 g | RMB 138 ≈ HKD 150|
| ZLTECH / Moons 10:1 planetary (V3–V4) | 10:1 | 13–14 N·m | 450–480 g | USD 38–42|
| 20:1 planetary (optional knee/hip upgrade) | 20:1 | 24–28 N·m | 620 g | USD 68–85|

## Software & Control (unchanged across all versions)

- RL: PyTorch + PPO  
- Primary simulator: MuJoCo (fastest iteration)  
- Secondary: Gazebo + ROS 2  
- Motion decomposition: micro-operations  
- Generative pipeline: BERT → Transformer dance/music  
- Dataset: S.O.F.I.A. (video + per-frame JSON)

## Final Conclusion & Roadmap

- 2016–2022: Pure theory & maximum DOF (V1–V2)  
- 2023-2024: Theoretical peak (V3) → realistic but still expensive (V4)  
- 2025: Heracles V5: the first version that an individual can actually build for **under HKD 6,000** while still performing leg-raise-to-head, full split, and 95° backbend.
- 2026: Heracles V6 – human-like hand/foot dexterity with robust performance upgrades

All CAD, firmware, RL code, MuJoCo models will be released open-source on GitHub.

The dream of a truly flexible, dancing, back-bending humanoid robot for less than the price of a high-end electric scooter is now mechanically and financially possible.
