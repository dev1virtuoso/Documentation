## Abstract

This technical report presents a comprehensive overview of an advanced AI-driven system for dance learning, creation, and execution, originally conceptualized as the Dance Learning and Creation System and later evolved into the K.R.I.S.T.Y. Dance module. Integrated with the Heracles humanoid robot platform, the system leverages computer vision, machine learning, and generative algorithms to process multi-angle video inputs, generate per-frame 3D keypoint JSON files, and map these to robot joints for precise dance replication. Key features include high fault-tolerance pose detection, micro-operation-based motion control, and music-synchronized choreography generation. The report details the system's architecture, operational principles, hardware integration, and theoretical strengths, drawing from a series of developmental documents spanning 2016 to the present. While focused on K-pop styles with expansions planned for other genres, the system emphasizes low-cost, open-source implementation for accessible robotics applications.

## Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics has revolutionized human-like motion synthesis, particularly in creative domains such as dance. This report documents the evolution and technical details of an AI-powered dance creation and execution system, now embodied in the K.R.I.S.T.Y. Dance module, deployed on the Heracles humanoid robot platform. Originating from foundational work in pose estimation and movement decomposition, the system enables robots to learn dances from video inputs, generate novel choreographies based on music or descriptions, and execute them with high precision.

The system's development timeline traces back to 2016, with key milestones including micro-operation motion control (2016–present), dance learning systems (2022–present), and the Heracles platform's progression from theoretical designs in 2024 to a buildable, cost-optimized version in 2026. Renamed from earlier iterations like Heracles Dance Module (HDM) or Choreography Harnessing Real-time Imaging for Step-by-Step Training and Nimble Adaptations (C.H.R.I.S.T.I.N.A.), the current K.R.I.S.T.Y. Dance (part of K.R.I.S.T.Y. v4.0) represents a multimodal generative AI framework. It processes inputs from diverse sources—such as frontal, dorsal, and overhead video clips—to output structured JSON data for robot mapping, ensuring seamless translation from human motion to robotic performance.

This report is structured as follows: an overview of the system, detailed operational principles, integration with the Heracles platform, theoretical analysis and evaluation, and a conclusion with future directions. All descriptions are based on conceptual and architectural details, without empirical experimental data.

## System Overview

The AI-powered dance creation and execution system is a modular, open-source platform designed for learning dance movements from videos and generating synchronized routines based on music or textual prompts. Optimized initially for K-pop choreography, it supports expansion to genres like hip-hop and Latin through database augmentation and model retraining. The core workflow involves capturing user or reference movements via cameras, detecting poses with high fault tolerance, decomposing actions into learnable segments, providing personalized guidance, and generating new dances.

Key components include:
- **Input Processing**: Real-time video streams from multiple angles (preferably overhead, frontal, and dorsal) for robust 3D reconstruction.
- **Pose Estimation**: Deep learning models (e.g., CNN or Transformer-based) tracking joint points across body parts.
- **Output Generation**: Per-frame JSON files recording 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) of keypoints, which are mapped to robot joints.
- **Dance Generation**: Integration with audio features (e.g., MFCC, chroma) and generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) for music-aligned choreography.
- **Robot Integration**: Mapping to the Heracles platform's motors and tendons for execution, enhanced by micro-operation decomposition for precision.

The system assumes good intent in user queries and prioritizes factual, high-level descriptions without actionable illicit details. It is built on a knowledge-driven architecture, with natural language interfaces for user interaction, allowing prompts like "Create a dance routine inspired by upbeat K-pop music."

## Operational Principles

### Image Acquisition
Image acquisition forms the foundation of the system, utilizing a high-resolution camera (recommended ≥1080p at 30fps) to capture real-time video streams. For optimal accuracy, inputs from three angles—overhead (top-down), frontal, and dorsal—are preferred, though single-angle (frontal or dorsal) processing is supported with reduced precision due to potential occlusions. Stable lighting and minimal background noise are essential to ensure smooth motion tracking. The system processes high-frame-rate videos to maintain temporal continuity, serving as input for subsequent pose analysis.

### Pose Detection Model
The pose detection employs advanced deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer architectures, to estimate and track joint points with high fault tolerance. This robustness handles variations like occlusions, lighting changes, or clothing interference. Body parts are analyzed with varying fault-tolerance rates to balance precision and computational efficiency:

- **Facial Features (95% Fault Tolerance)**: Tracks ~5 joint points using high-accuracy models (e.g., ResNet or Transformer-based) for subtle expressions.
- **Head Movements (90% Fault Tolerance)**: Monitors tilt and rotation for upper body alignment.
- **Arm Gestures (92% Fault Tolerance)**: One joint per major point (shoulder, elbow, wrist) with medium-accuracy hand rotation.
- **Hand Positions (94% Fault Tolerance)**: High-density points on finger joints for intricate gestures.
- **Chest Movements (88% Fault Tolerance)**: Moderate accuracy for undulation and rotation.
- **Hip Rotations (91% Fault Tolerance)**: Tracks angle changes for lower body dynamics.
- **Leg Positions (89% Fault Tolerance)**: Monitors knee and hip for coordination.
- **Foot Placements (93% Fault Tolerance)**: High-density toe joints for precise footwork.

These rates ensure reliable performance, with higher tolerances for expressive elements like hands and feet critical in K-pop.

### Movement Learning and Decomposition
Movements are segmented into short clips (5–10 seconds) using temporal analysis or neural networks (e.g., LSTM or Transformer for action segmentation). Features are extracted per body part, creating structured learning paths. This decomposition draws from micro-operation principles, where complex motions are broken into atomic units (e.g., single steps, turns) based on kinematics and dynamics. An AI model calculates required micro-operations dynamically, adapting to task demands and environmental feedback.

### Personalized Guidance
The system compares user movements against reference choreography using metrics like Euclidean distance or Dynamic Time Warping. Deviations trigger natural language feedback (e.g., "Raise arm 10 degrees"), processed with low latency (<100ms) for real-time instruction.

### JSON Output and Joint Mapping
From processed videos, the system outputs a JSON file per frame, recording 3D keypoints (X, Y, Z coordinates) relative to a world or camera coordinate system. The JSON structure includes:
- Timestamp or frame ID.
- Number of keypoints.
- Per-keypoint data: coordinates, body part label (e.g., left_wrist), and confidence score.

These keypoints are mapped to the robot's joints via a predefined skeleton mapping table, converting coordinates to motor angles. Special handling accounts for robot-specific constraints, such as under-actuated hands or segmented waist.

### Dance Generation
Dance routines are generated from music inputs (e.g., K-pop tracks) via audio feature extraction (MFCC, chroma, BPM). A pre-trained motion database combines with generative models (GANs or diffusion) to produce synchronized sequences, output as JSON for mapping. Natural language prompts enable custom creations, with style-transfer for genre adaptation.

### Future Expansion
Plans include multi-genre support via expanded databases and enhanced models, incorporating style-transfer (e.g., StyleGAN) for diverse characteristics.

## Integration with Heracles Humanoid Robot Platform

The Heracles platform, evolved from Project Mojave/Heracles (2020–present), is an open-source humanoid robot emphasizing flexibility and low cost. Versions progress from V1 (2024, 46 motors, ~USD 689) to V5 (2026, 46 motors, ~HKD 5,940/~USD 760), using planetary geared steppers (5:1 ratio, 7–8 N·m torque) for critical motions like 155° hip flexion or 95° backbend.

Key hardware:
- **Motors and Tendons**: V5 maps 46 motors to ~45–48 DOF, with Dyneema tendons and springs for hybrid actuation.
- **Waist and Turret**: 5-segment spine (10 motors) for backbends, plus 360° turret.
- **Computing and Control**: ESP32-C6 board, TB6600 drivers, MuJoCo simulation.
- **Battery and Sensors**: 6S LiPo batteries, IMUs, cameras.

The dance system maps JSON keypoints to these components, using micro-operations for execution, real-time adjustments, and safety mechanisms.
