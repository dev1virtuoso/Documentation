## Introduction

This report evaluates the process of generating SHA-256 hashes for common words and their combinations, leveraging the [SecLists repository] (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, Ignacio Portal, and g0tmi1k. The objective is to demonstrate the vulnerability of unsalted hashing for common wordlists and advocate for the use of salting in cryptographic applications to enhance security.

## Background

SecLists is a comprehensive collection of lists used in security assessments, including usernames, passwords, URLs, and more. The `Passwords` directory contains numerous `.txt` files with common passwords and wordlists (e.g., `10k-most-common.txt`), ideal for testing cryptographic strength. SHA-256, a widely used cryptographic hash function, produces a 256-bit (64-character hexadecimal) hash. However, without salting, hashed common words are susceptible to precomputed attacks (e.g., rainbow tables).

## Methodology

A [Python script](20250725_01.py) was developed to:

1. Clone the SecLists repository into the script’s directory.
2. Process all `.txt` files in the `SecLists/Passwords` directory.
3. Generate SHA-256 hashes for each line of text (word or combination).
4. Output results to a CSV file (`output_hashed.csv`) with columns for original text and its SHA-256 hash.

### Script Overview

- **Dependencies**: `tqdm` (progress bar), `cryptography` (SHA-256 hashing), `csv`, `os`, `subprocess`.
- **Process**:
  - Clones SecLists using `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git` if not already present.
  - Traverses `SecLists/Passwords` to collect `.txt` files.
  - Computes SHA-256 hashes for each non-empty line using the `cryptography` library.
  - Writes results to `output_hashed.csv` with columns `Original` and `SHA256`.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for folder existence, read permissions, and file access issues.
- **Output**: A CSV file listing original words and their SHA-256 hashes.

### Example Output

For a sample input from `SecLists/Passwords/10k-most-common.txt` (e.g., “password”, “123456”):

```
Original, SHA256
password, 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8
123456, 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92
```

## Findings

- **Hashing Common Words**: The script successfully processed thousands of words from SecLists, generating unique SHA-256 hashes for each. For example, the `Passwords` directory contains files like `10k-most-common.txt`, which includes frequently used passwords.
- **Vulnerability of Unsalted Hashes**: SHA-256 hashes of common words (e.g., “password”) are predictable and easily reversible using precomputed rainbow tables or online databases (e.g., CrackStation). For instance, the hash `5e884898...` is widely known to correspond to “password”.
- **Performance**: Processing large wordlists (e.g., millions of lines in SecLists) is computationally efficient with the `cryptography` library, but the lack of salting makes these hashes vulnerable.
- **Scalability**: The script handles multiple `.txt` files across subdirectories, making it suitable for large datasets like SecLists.

## Security Implications

The experiment highlights the critical weakness of unsalted SHA-256 hashing for common words and combinations:

- **Precomputed Attacks**: Attackers can use precomputed hash tables to reverse unsalted SHA-256 hashes, especially for common passwords in SecLists.
- **Collision Resistance**: While SHA-256 is collision-resistant, its deterministic nature without salting allows attackers to match hashes against known wordlists.
- **Recommendation**: Add a unique, random salt (e.g., 16+ bytes) to each input before hashing to prevent precomputed attacks. A salted hash function (e.g., `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac` or `bcrypt`) should be used for password storage.

### Example with Salting

Using `cryptography` with a random salt:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import os

def hash_with_salt(text, salt):
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
    digest.update(text.encode('utf-8') + salt)
    return digest.finalize().hex()

text = "password"
salt = os.urandom(16)  # Random 16-byte salt
hashed = hash_with_salt(text, salt)
# Output: Unique hash per salt, e.g., 'a1b2c3...' (varies with salt)
```

Salting ensures that identical inputs (e.g., “password”) produce different hashes, mitigating rainbow table attacks.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Salting**: Always append a unique, random salt to inputs before hashing to ensure unique outputs and protect against precomputed attacks.
2. **Adopt Stronger Hash Functions**: For password storage, use adaptive hash functions like `bcrypt`, `Argon2`, or `PBKDF2`, which are designed for slow computation and include built-in salting.
3. **Secure Storage**: Store salts securely alongside hashes (e.g., in a database) to enable verification without compromising security.
4. **Leverage SecLists**: Continue using SecLists for testing and auditing, as its comprehensive wordlists (maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, Ignacio Portal, and g0tmi1k) are ideal for identifying weak passwords.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates that SHA-256 hashing of common words and combinations from SecLists is straightforward but insecure without salting. Unsalted hashes are vulnerable to precomputed attacks, as shown by processing SecLists’ `Passwords` directory. Adding a random salt per input is essential to enhance security, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to reverse hashes using rainbow tables. For secure applications, salted hashing or specialized password hashing functions should be adopted.
