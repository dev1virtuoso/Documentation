## Research Background

In oral care products, particularly chewing gum, the base is a crucial component. However, traditional bases may pose risks of producing harmful substances when ingested or causing environmental pollution. Hence, this study aims to explore the use of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as an alternative base to develop a chewing gum formula that is safe for ingestion, environmentally friendly in acidic conditions, and can be excreted in human feces.

## Research Objectives

This research aims to develop oral care products that meet safety standards, utilizing PLGA as the base to ensure safety and sustainability under various conditions.

### Research Methods

1. **Material Selection and Formulation Design**: Determine the appropriate PLGA formulation ratio to ensure the desired physical properties and biocompatibility.
2. **Safety Assessment**: Evaluate the breakdown behavior of PLGA in acidic environments and the safety of its byproducts through laboratory testing and simulated digestion processes.
3. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Study the behavior of PLGA in human feces to ensure safe excretion without harmful effects on the environment.
4. **Risk Assessment for Blockages**: Evaluate the performance of PLGA in the digestive tract under various ingestion levels to prevent blockage risks.

## Expected Results

1. **Safe Ingestibility**: Chewing gum with PLGA as the base will be safe for ingestion, free from harmful substances.
2. **Environmentally Friendly**: PLGA will safely degrade in acidic environments and be excreted in human feces without environmental contamination.
3. **Prevention of Blockages**: After assessment, PLGA is expected not to pose blockage risks under various ingestion levels.

## Application Value

The success of this study will provide a new direction for developing safer and more environmentally friendly oral care products, with potential applications in other ingestible product manufacturing sectors, contributing to human health and environmental protection.

## Conclusion

Through this research, the developed chewing gum formula with a PLGA base will meet safety and environmental standards, offering a safer and more sustainable option for oral care products, while making contributions to environmental protection and sustainable development.
