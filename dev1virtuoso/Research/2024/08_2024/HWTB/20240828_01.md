1. It is the result of the interaction between emotions and physiological responses. When we establish an intimate relationship with someone, our bodies release a hormone called oxytocin, which is associated with emotional connection and attachment. When this relationship ends and a breakup occurs, the secretion of oxytocin decreases, while stress hormones such as cortisol increase.
2. Feeling emotionally lost, sad, and lonely triggers a stress response, leading to the release of stress hormones in the body. This can affect the heart and cardiovascular system, causing increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and vascular constriction, resulting in a feeling of heartache.
