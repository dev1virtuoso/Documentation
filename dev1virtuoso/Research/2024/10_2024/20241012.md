## Abstract
This study aims to explore the usage of vulgar language in different social contexts and its impact on interpersonal communication and social interaction. By analyzing how vulgar language integrates into various social circles, describing situations that cannot be accurately expressed with normal language, and discussing users' attitudes towards these languages, we will examine the role of vulgar language in linguistics and sociology.

## Research Methodology
This study employs literature review and historical analysis methods. By researching relevant literature and data, we will trace the historical origins of vulgar language, explore its evolution in different periods and cultures, and analyze its influence in society.

## Evolution of Vulgar Language
1. **Origins**: The use of vulgar language can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In many cultures, vulgar language is seen as a challenge to social norms and also as a way to express strong emotions or feelings.

2. **Medieval to Modern Times**: Throughout different periods in history, the use of vulgar language has been subject to varying degrees of restriction and norms. From medieval times to the present day, with changes in societal values and language evolution, the status and function of vulgar language have also evolved.

3. **Cultural Influence**: Vulgar language is not just a part of language but also reflects the characteristics and values of society and culture. The ways in which vulgar language is used and its meanings may vary in different cultures, influenced by the cultural value system and moral concepts.

## Impact and Discussion
1. **Linguistic Impact**: Vulgar language holds certain research value in linguistics, helping us understand the evolution and diversity of language. Additionally, vulgar language reflects the social function of language and cultural background.

2. **Social Impact**: The use of vulgar language in society may be influenced by moral norms and societal expectations. Its role in social communication and interaction warrants further research and discussion.

## Research Approach
This study adopts a qualitative research approach, collecting data through interviews, observations, and text analysis. We selected respondents from diverse social backgrounds and cultures to understand their perspectives on vulgar language and its usage in different contexts.

## Results and Discussion
1. **Integration into Different Circles**: The study found that vulgar language is used differently in various social circles. In some circles, vulgar language is seen as part of social interaction, adding humor and closeness; whereas in others, using vulgar language may be considered impolite or inappropriate.

2. **Describing Uncertain Situations**: Sometimes, vulgar language is used to describe situations or emotions that may be difficult to accurately express using normal language. In these cases, vulgar language may be seen as a mode of expression rather than mere profanity.

3. **Influence of User Attitudes**: This study emphasizes that the perception of vulgar language depends on the user's attitude towards it. Some may have an open attitude towards vulgar language, seeing it as enriching language and expressive, while others may believe it should not be used as it could lead to unnecessary conflicts or offense.

## Conclusion
In the conclusion section, we point out that vulgar language is just one form of language, and its perception depends on users' attitudes and usage contexts. Vulgar language can integrate into different social circles and be used to describe situations that are uncertain using normal language. Therefore, we should approach vulgar language with an open and understanding attitude, recognizing its diversity and complexity in language and social interaction.
