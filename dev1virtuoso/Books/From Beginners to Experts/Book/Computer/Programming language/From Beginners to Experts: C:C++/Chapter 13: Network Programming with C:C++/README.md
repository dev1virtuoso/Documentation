## Chapter 13: Network Programming with C/C++

In this chapter, we will delve into network programming using C and C++. Network programming is essential for developing applications that communicate over networks, ranging from simple client-server interactions to complex distributed systems. By harnessing the capabilities of C and C++, you can create efficient and robust networked applications.

#### Section 13.1: Introduction to Network Programming

Understand the fundamentals of network programming and its significance in building applications that communicate over local and wide area networks. Explore the client-server model, socket programming, network protocols, and data serialization for network communication.

#### Section 13.2: Socket Programming in C/C++

Learn about socket programming in C/C++ for establishing network connections, sending and receiving data between client and server applications. Explore socket types, socket options, address families, and socket operations for network communication.

#### Section 13.3: TCP/IP and UDP Communication

Delve into TCP/IP and UDP communication in C/C++ for reliable and connectionless data transmission over networks. Understand the differences between TCP and UDP protocols, their use cases, and how to implement TCP and UDP sockets in network applications.

#### Section 13.4: Concurrent Network Programming
