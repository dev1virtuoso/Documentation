The output of one phase serves as the input for the next phase, resembling a waterfall flowing downwards.

**Phases in the Waterfall Model:**

1. **Requirements Gathering:**
   - In this initial phase, requirements are gathered from stakeholders and documented in a detailed requirements specification document.

2. **System Design:**
   - The system design phase involves creating a detailed system design based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase. This includes defining system architecture, modules, interfaces, and data structures.

3. **Implementation:**
   - During the implementation phase, the system is developed based on the detailed design specifications. Developers write code, integrate modules, and create the software product.

4. **Testing:**
   - Testing is done to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Testing includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Once testing is completed successfully, the software is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installation, configuration, and making the software available to end-users.

6. **Maintenance:**
   - The maintenance phase involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software. This includes fixing bugs, making enhancements, and addressing user feedback.

**Characteristics of the Waterfall Model:**

- **Sequential Approach:** Phases are completed one after the other, with no overlap between them.
- **Document-Driven:** Emphasis is placed on documentation at each phase, with clear documentation serving as a key deliverable.
- **Rigid and Predictive:** The model is less flexible to changes once a phase is completed, making it suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
- **Well-Suited for Small Projects:** It is often used for small projects where requirements are clear from the beginning.

**Advantages:**
- Clear project documentation.
- Well-structured and easy to understand.
- Suitable for projects with stable requirements.

**Disadvantages:**
