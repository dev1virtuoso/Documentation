## Chapter 6: File Handling and Streams

In this chapter, we will delve into file handling and streams in C++, exploring how to read from and write to files using various stream classes provided by the C++ standard library.

#### Section 6.1: Introduction to File Handling

File handling in C++ involves interactions with files on the filesystem. C++ provides stream classes to perform input and output operations on files.

#### Section 6.2: Stream Classes in C++

C++ offers several stream classes for file handling:

- **`ifstream`**: Input file stream for reading from files.
- **`ofstream`**: Output file stream for writing to files.
- **`fstream`**: File stream that supports both input and output operations.

#### Section 6.3: Opening and Closing Files

To open a file in C++, you can use the `open()` method of the stream classes. Remember to close the file after performing operations using the `close()` method.

#### Section 6.4: Reading from Files

You can read data from files using `ifstream` and various input operations like `>>` for formatted input or `getline()` for reading entire lines.

#### Section 6.5: Writing to Files

`ofstream` allows you to write data to files using output operations like `<<` for formatted output or `write()` for writing raw data.

#### Section 6.6: Error Handling in File Operations

Always check for errors when performing file operations. Stream classes provide methods like `good()`, `fail()`, `bad()`, and `eof()` to handle errors effectively.

#### Section 6.7: Case Study: Reading and Writing Files

Let's look at an example of reading from a file and writing to another file in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::ifstream inputFile("input.txt");
    std::ofstream outputFile("output.txt");

    if (inputFile.is_open() && outputFile.is_open()) {
        std::string line;
        while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {
            outputFile << line << std::endl;
        }

        std::cout << "File copied successfully." << std::endl;

        inputFile.close();
        outputFile.close();
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Error opening files." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we read from an input file "input.txt" and write its contents to an output file "output.txt".

#### Conclusion

File handling and streams in C++ are essential for interacting with files, reading data, and writing data efficiently. By mastering file handling operations using stream classes like `ifstream` and `ofstream`, you can work with files seamlessly in your C++ programs. Understanding error handling techniques and best practices in file operations is crucial for developing robust software applications that involve reading and writing files. In the subsequent chapters, we will explore advanced file handling concepts, binary file operations, and more sophisticated file manipulation techniques in C++.
