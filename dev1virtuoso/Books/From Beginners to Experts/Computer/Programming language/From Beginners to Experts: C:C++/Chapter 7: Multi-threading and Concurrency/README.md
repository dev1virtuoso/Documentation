## Chapter 7: Multi-threading and Concurrency

In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of multi-threading and concurrency in C++, focusing on how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and handle concurrent operations effectively.

#### Section 7.1: Introduction to Multi-threading

Multi-threading allows programs to execute multiple threads concurrently, enabling better utilization of multi-core processors and improved performance in handling parallel tasks.

#### Section 7.2: Creating Threads in C++

C++ provides the `<thread>` header for creating and managing threads. You can create threads by defining a function and passing it to a `std::thread` object for execution.

#### Section 7.3: Synchronizing Threads

Synchronization is crucial when multiple threads access shared resources to prevent data races and ensure data integrity. C++ offers various synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations.

#### Section 7.4: Mutexes and Locks

Mutexes (mutual exclusions) are used to protect critical sections of code from simultaneous access by multiple threads. Locks like `std::lock_guard` and `std::unique_lock` help in managing mutexes efficiently.

#### Section 7.5: Condition Variables

Condition variables allow threads to wait for a certain condition to become true before proceeding. They are often used in producer-consumer scenarios and other synchronization tasks.

#### Section 7.6: Atomic Operations

Atomic operations ensure that certain operations are performed atomically without interference from other threads. They are useful for implementing lock-free algorithms and ensuring thread safety.

#### Section 7.7: Case Study: Multi-threading in C++

Let's consider an example where multiple threads increment a shared counter using mutexes for synchronization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;
int sharedCounter = 0;

void incrementCounter() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        sharedCounter++;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(incrementCounter);
    std::thread t2(incrementCounter);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Shared counter value: " << sharedCounter << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, two threads increment a shared counter in a synchronized manner using a mutex to prevent data races.

#### Conclusion

Multi-threading and concurrency in C++ are powerful tools for parallel programming, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and improved performance in handling concurrent tasks. By understanding how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and utilize synchronization primitives effectively, you can develop robust and scalable multi-threaded applications in C++. In the upcoming chapters, we will delve deeper into advanced multi-threading concepts, thread pools, futures, and asynchronous programming techniques to further enhance your knowledge and skills in concurrent programming.
