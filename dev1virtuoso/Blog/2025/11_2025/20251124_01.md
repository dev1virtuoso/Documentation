# A Difficult but Necessary Update: Delay to Our Upcoming Releases

Dear Community,

It is with deep regret that I must inform you of a significant delay to our upcoming model releases.

Despite exhaustive efforts by me, unforeseen technical and infrastructural challenges, entirely beyond my control, have made it impossible to meet the previously announced launch date of 25 November 2025. After careful evaluation and consultation with all relevant stakeholders, I have concluded that proceeding under the current constraints would compromise the quality, safety, and performance standards I have committed to upholding.

Accordingly, I have taken the difficult but necessary decision to postpone all four planned releases by two full quarters.

**Previous Schedule (no longer valid):**
- A.R.I.E.L. – 25 November 2025  
- C.H.R.I.S.T.I.N.A. – Q1 2026  
- K.R.I.S.T.Y. – 25 November 2025  
- L.E.P.A.U.T.E. – 25 November 2025  

**Revised Schedule:**
- A.R.I.E.L. – Q2 2026  
- C.H.R.I.S.T.I.N.A. – Q2 2026  
- K.R.I.S.T.Y. – Q2 2026  
- L.E.P.A.U.T.E. – Q2 2026  

I fully recognize the disappointment this will cause and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration it will inevitably create. These projects represent years of intensive research and development, and the decision to delay was not taken lightly. However, releasing models that fall short of our own rigorous internal benchmarks, and of the expectations you rightly hold, would be unacceptable.

The additional time will be used to resolve the outstanding issues completely and to implement substantial improvements that would not have been possible under the original timeline. When these models are finally made available in the second quarter of 2026, they will reflect the full extent of our capabilities and justify the extended wait.

I remain personally committed to delivering on our promises and will ensure that future updates are communicated promptly and transparently.

Thank you for your continued trust and understanding during this challenging period.

Sincerely,  
Carson
