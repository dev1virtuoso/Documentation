# Understanding Intellectual Property: VEX IQ 2024 Competition

Greetings,

I'm Carson Wu, and I'm excited to share my experiences from the VEX IQ 2024 competition, focusing on the significance of intellectual property rights in software development and creative innovations.

In the context of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Ordinance, computer software is recognized as a form of "literary work." Throughout the competition, I dedicated myself to enhancing and creatively modifying the provided code, infusing it with fresh ideas and innovative elements that reflect my unique skills and perspectives.

According to the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance, particularly Section 4, which pertains to "literary, dramatic, and musical works," I strongly believe that these modifications deserve due respect and protection.

Transparency and ethical conduct have always been paramount to me. Prior to the competition, no confidentiality agreements were in place. As a result, any code shared on GitHub adhered to regulations and did not violate any confidentiality agreements.

Section 242A(2)(a) of the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance delves into the purpose and nature of modifications, particularly in non-profit and educational settings, emphasizing the legitimacy of creative efforts within these domains.

I am dedicated to fostering open communication and seeking amicable resolutions with my peers to ensure fair outcomes for all involved. Through mutual respect and understanding, I aim to resolve disputes harmoniously and maintain positive relationships.

In conclusion, I want to clarify that the code shared on GitHub represents an older version and does not reflect the latest iterations used in the competition. By utilizing the MIT license, I underscore my commitment to lawful sharing practices.

Therefore, I will maintain all data related to this competition that I have already open-sourced, including code, photos, and documents. Consequently, I cannot comply with the request: 'What's the purpose of putting it online? And all competition-related materials cannot be made public without my consent,' as well as 'Please immediately close the entire website, especially the competition-related images.'

Thank you for investing your time in reading this blog post and gaining insights into the complexities of intellectual property rights in the digital era.

Warm regards,

Carson Wu
