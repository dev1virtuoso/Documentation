# My open source journey

## A new step on GitHub Sponsors

I am honored to announce on August 10, 2024, that I have opened GitHub Sponsors! This is an important milestone that will help support my open source development efforts.

This decision means that I will use 100% of the proceeds to develop and maintain my open source projects. Through this support, I will be able to devote more time and energy to improving and expanding my open source projects while contributing to the entire open source community.

## My promise

As a developer, I know the importance of open source communities for technological innovation and shared knowledge. Therefore, I promise to continue working hard not only to improve the quality of my open source projects, but also to actively participate in and support other open source projects.
