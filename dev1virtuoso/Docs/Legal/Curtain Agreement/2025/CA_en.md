## Management framework and principles

### Preface

The Curtain Agreement was developed to ensure the privacy protection and fair use of personal data in the digital age. As the volume of data processed continues to increase, individuals and organizations face more challenges and responsibilities to ensure data security and transparency. The purpose of this agreement is to provide clear guidelines internally to ensure data processing is compliant and ethical.

In this agreement, we aim to emphasize the importance of personal data privacy and ensure that personal information is not improperly used, disclosed or misused. We hope to provide individuals and organizations with mechanisms to protect and control their personal data by establishing clear rules and processes.

At the same time, we also encourage appropriate data sharing and collaboration to support effective operations and innovation within the organization. We recognize that data sharing can bring many benefits, but it must also be done within a compliance framework to ensure data security and legality.

In order to better manage and share data, and protect the security of data, we have established a classification system with different confidentiality levels. This will help individuals and organizations understand the sensitivity of their data and take appropriate steps to protect and control it.

Finally, we emphasize individual responsibility and autonomy, and individuals have the right to determine the use and access of their own data. We encourage individuals to actively participate in decision-making processes regarding data processing and ensure they have control over and protection of their data.

The name "Curtain Protocol" was chosen to imply the balance between data processing and privacy protection. As an object that blocks sight, the curtain symbolizes data confidentiality and privacy protection. At the same time, the curtain also symbolizes transparency and openness, allowing the data processing process to be known to legal and authorized persons. The name is intended to convey the idea of ​​ensuring compliance and reasonableness of data processing while protecting privacy.

By complying with the Curtain Agreement, we believe that individuals and organizations can better handle and protect data, ensuring the appropriate use of data and the security of privacy. Only by working together can we establish a sustainable framework for data processing and privacy protection in the digital age.

### Background

In the digital age, the amount of data processed by individuals and organizations continues to increase, and the processing and privacy protection of data have become critical. With the advancement of technology and the popularization of information, the collection, storage and use of personal data have become the norm. At the same time, issues of privacy protection and reasonable use of data have also attracted increasing attention.

The privacy leakage of personal data may lead to damage to personal rights, destruction of trust and potential risks of abuse. In addition, organizations face challenges such as data security, compliance and reputational risks when dealing with large amounts of data. Therefore, establishing a clear set of guidelines and norms to ensure the appropriate use and protection of data has become a priority.

The purpose of the Curtain Agreement is to regulate internal data processing and privacy protection and ensure that individuals and organizations comply with compliance and ethical standards when processing data. The Agreement was introduced to provide individuals and organizations with a framework that clarifies the guidelines and principles for data processing, as well as measures and requirements to protect personal privacy.

When formulating the Curtain Agreement, different levels of data sensitivity and access rights need to be taken into account, and corresponding controls and restrictions need to be developed. For example, divide the data into different levels and determine the access rights of personnel according to the level to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and process the data of the corresponding level.

In addition, the formulation of the agreement also needs to focus on the reasonable use and sharing of data. Appropriate sharing and cooperation of data can promote effective operations and innovation within the organization, but at the same time, compliance principles must be followed to ensure the security and legality of data.

By formulating the Curtain Agreement, individuals and organizations can better understand the importance of data processing and privacy protection, clarify their responsibilities and obligations, and take corresponding measures to protect the privacy and security of data. Only by rationally using and protecting data while protecting personal privacy can we establish a trustful and sustainable data processing system in the digital age.

### Set purpose

1. Provide clear guidance internally on data processing (privacy): The purpose of the Curtain Agreement is to provide clear guidance internally to ensure that individuals and organizations adhere to compliance and ethical standards when processing data. The agreement will clearly stipulate the principles, procedures and specifications for data processing and provide guidance to internal members to ensure that their actions in data processing comply with compliance requirements.

2. Protection of the privacy of personal data: One of the purposes of the Agreement is to ensure that the privacy of personal data is not subject to improper use, disclosure or abuse. By formulating clear privacy protection measures and requirements, the agreement will ensure that personal data is properly protected, prevent unauthorized access and abuse, and protect personal privacy rights.

3. Promote appropriate data sharing and collaboration: The agreement encourages appropriate data sharing and collaboration to support effective operations and innovation within the organization. By clarifying the compliance framework and regulations, the agreement will help organizations ensure the security and legality of data during data sharing and cooperation, promote information sharing and collaborative work, thereby improving the organization's efficiency and innovation capabilities.

4. Establish a classification system with different confidentiality levels: In order to better manage and share data and protect the security of the data, the protocol has established a classification system with different confidentiality levels. The system will help individuals and organizations understand the sensitivity of data and determine access rights and controls based on different levels to ensure data is appropriately protected and controlled.

5. Emphasis on personal responsibility and autonomy: The agreement emphasizes individual responsibility and autonomy for their own data. Individuals have the right to determine the use and access of their own data and can actively participate in the decision-making process of data processing. The agreement will encourage individuals to exercise autonomy and ensure that they control and protect their data, while also fulfilling corresponding responsibilities and complying with compliance requirements and privacy protection measures.
