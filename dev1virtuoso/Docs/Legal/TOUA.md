### Absolute Prohibitions (Red Lines: Never Allowed)

Regardless of the above license, you may never:
1. File or cause to be filed any patent application (utility, design, or otherwise) that claims an invention derived from or substantially based on the Works  
2. Directly sell, NFT-mint, or otherwise monetize the original or lightly-modified Works as standalone digital assets  
3. Use the Works for military weapons, real-time surveillance systems, medical diagnosis/treatment decisions, or non-consensual deepfake pornography/political content
