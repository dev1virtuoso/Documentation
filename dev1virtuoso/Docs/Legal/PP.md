## 1. Privacy as a Fundamental Right

Privacy is considered a fundamental human right and a core value for us. As such, our products and services are designed with a focus on safeguarding your privacy, reflecting our dedication to this belief.

## 2. Innovative Privacy Protection Measures

Our products and features incorporate innovative privacy protection technologies and techniques to limit access to your data by us or any unauthorized parties. We employ robust security features to prevent unauthorized access to your device.

## 3. Measures to Protect Your Privacy and Information

- Data Encryption: We ensure that your information is encrypted to a level where even we cannot access your data.
- On-Device Processing: All operations are conducted on your device without the need to transmit data to external servers, allowing us to offer advanced features without accessing your information.
- Machine Learning Model: Our machine learning model is designed to learn offline directly on your device whenever feasible. Searches and requests are associated with a random alphanumeric identifier rather than your personal ID.
- Device-Based Recommendations: Personal data is stored on your device when utilizing our machine learning model for searches or suggestions, and not transmitted to our servers.
- Privacy in Voice Requests: Audio requests made to our machine learning model are processed solely on your device unless you choose to share them. Our neural network-powered speech recognition model matches the capabilities of server-based recognition.
